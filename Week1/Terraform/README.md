# Terraform

## What is Terraform?

Terraform is an **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** tool used to **create**, **update**, and **delete** cloud or on-prem infrastructure in a safe, repeatable, 
and automated way.

Instead of manually provisioning resources through a cloud console, Terraform allows us to define infrastructure using simple configuration files. This makes 
deployments:

- **Scalable**
- **Version-controlled**
- **Reusable**
- **Consistent across environments**

In the DataTalksClub Data Engineering Zoomcamp, Terraform is used to automatically set up essential cloud resources such as storage buckets, service accounts, 
permissions, and compute components needed for the data pipeline.
